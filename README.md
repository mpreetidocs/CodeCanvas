### 'CodeCanvas'
Developed a CodePen clone - ### 'CodeCanvas' using React, which involved creating a fully functional text editor that allows users to write and preview custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time. This project provided hands-on experience in building a dynamic editor interface and managing code execution and rendering.
